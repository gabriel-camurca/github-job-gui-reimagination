At Propelor, we do things differently.\\r\\n \\r\\nWe believe in the original spirit of Agile, but follow a more light-weight product approach called ShapeUp across an integrated team. We don’t believe in distinguishing between the “dev team,” “product team” or “business team”, instead, those responsible for building our products are on the “build team”. We give people more trust, flexibility and responsibility to get things done, not less.\\r\\n \\r\\nEach product cycle depends on having everyone aligned on what we want to build and how long it’s going to take. At that point, the build team self-organizes and manages their own schedules around the deliverable. We don’t get it right every time, but we find that giving people more control and freedom day-to-day leads to a better work life and more progress over time.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs a Senior Developer you’ll be working within our microservices architecture, based on the Rails framework and work in 4-6 week product cycles. As an open source guru, you’ll design and implement new systems, introduce new technologies, make calls, take ownership of the code and get things done.\\r\\n \\r\\nYou’re a developer at heart, but are also interested in the big picture and care a lot about users. You communicate clearly with colleagues, easily work across teams, and lend a helping hand when needed. You understand the importance of teamwork in building something bigger than yourself.\\r\\n \\r\\nHere are some things we’ve worked on recently to give you a sense of what you’ll be doing day-to-day:\\r\\n- Leveraged the power of Ruby proc to build a flexible classification methodology for investment securities\\r\\n- Integrated StimulusJS with Rails to power fast asynchronous responses to user’s investing behaviors\\r\\n- Built an API that connected user generated data with the data management platform\\r\\n- Customized a component of our ETL platform that aggregates complex financial data to improve maintainability and reliability\\r\\n \\r\\n## About Us\\r\\nPropelor is a privately held company.
